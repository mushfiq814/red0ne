# Reddit Red0ne
A simple reddit API client built with React TypeScript that logs in using OAuth 2.0.

## Setup
Create `src/.config/.env` by duplicating `src/.config/.env.example` and replacing the values with your reddit credentials that you can get from [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps). You will need:
* Reddit Client ID
* Reddit Client Secret
* Redirect URL

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts
### Starting the development server
To run the app in the development mode, use `yarn start`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Build application for production 
To build the app for production to the `build` folder, use `yarn build`. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
